# London Cafes Django Project
### Web App that displays curated places/cafes to Hack in London	
Django, Python, SASS, Grunt/Gulp, HTML

## Description
This is volunteer idea to create a web app that will display and allow searching of curated cafes places that are team friendly to go and spend some time hacking together on a project.

The user can come to the website and search bases on London postcode/locations to find a curated list of cafes matching that criteria. The cafes should be shown on a map as well.
Each cafe will be handpicked and “features” ranked like wifi signal, how great is the coffee/food and space etc.
